## Commit Guidelines

**CRITICAL**: Commit your work atomically as you progress.

### When to Commit

✅ **DO commit** after:
- Implementing a complete function or component
- Fixing a bug (with test)
- Completing a logical unit of work
- Passing tests for a feature
- Refactoring that doesn't change behavior

❌ **DON'T commit**:
- Broken/incomplete code
- Code that doesn't compile
- Failed tests
- Debug code or console.logs

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body - optional>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- `test`: Add/update tests
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `chore`: Maintenance (deps, config, etc.)

**Examples**:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): Add JWT authentication middleware

Implements token generation and validation using jsonwebtoken.
Includes expiry handling and refresh token support.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

```bash
git commit -m "fix(api): Handle null response in user endpoint

Added null check before accessing user.profile.
Returns 404 if user not found instead of 500 error.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

### Automatic Dashboard Sync

**Good news**: You don't need to manually update STATUS_DASHBOARD.md!

The system automatically syncs your progress every 3-5 commits:
- Commit counter tracks your work
- Post-commit hook triggers dashboard update
- Dashboard shows: commits, files changed, latest message
- Sync runs in background (non-blocking)

Just keep committing atomically and the dashboard will stay current.

**Next Steps**:
1. Navigate to worktree: `cd {{WORKTREE_PATH}}`
2. Review this handoff
3. Begin implementation
4. **Commit atomically as you go** (every logical unit)
5. When ready: call `prepare_merge`
